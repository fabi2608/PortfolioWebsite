**Project Overview:**
Survival Ignaz is an action-packed survival game developed with Unity and C#. In this game, players control the protagonist, Ignaz, who must survive on a dangerous island. The island is constantly under threat by enemies such as skeletons and zombies. Ignaz has to use his wits and available resources to fight back, protect his life, and build defenses in order to survive.
 
## Objectives
 
1. Create an immersive and engaging survival experience with a playable character (Ignaz) who defends himself from hostile enemies.
2. Develop dynamic gameplay where players can place trees and test tubes to build defenses against attacking enemies.
3. Implement a challenging island environment that the player can navigate while managing health, resources, and survival tactics.
 
## Features
 
1. **Playable Character:**
   - The protagonist, Ignaz, can move, fight, and build in an open-world environment.
   - Health is gradually reduced when attacked by enemies, forcing players to carefully plan their defense strategies.
 
2. **Enemy Encounters:**
   - Skeletons and zombies are among the many types of enemies that Ignaz will encounter during gameplay.
   - Enemies are AI-controlled and attack Ignaz on sight, providing a constantly changing challenge for players.
 
3. **Building Defenses:**
   - Players can place trees and test tubes to create defensive barriers, slowing down or stopping the enemies' progress.
   - This allows for strategic thinking as players can control the environment to protect themselves from waves of enemies.
 
4. **Island Map:**
   - The game world is a self-created island map, filled with dangers and opportunities for exploration.
   - The map is designed to be challenging, with different terrains that require players to think creatively to survive.
 
## Technology Stack
 
- **Game Engine:** Unity for building the 3D world and gameplay mechanics.
- **Scripting:** C# for game logic and interaction.
- **Graphics:** Pixel art for character and environmental design, creating a retro-inspired visual aesthetic.
- **Version Control:** GitHub for team collaboration, allowing for version control and efficient project management.
