**Project Overview:**
SuperChat is a simple yet powerful chat application developed using ASP.NET and C#. The platform allows users to create accounts, interact with others by initiating chats, and send/receive messages in real-time. One of its key features is the ability to manage users and messages, including deleting both user accounts and messages. The project ran over the course of 3-4 months, providing a hands-on experience in building chat applications with a focus on user management and real-time messaging.
 
## Objectives
 
1. Develop a basic chat application where users can communicate with each other.
2. Implement functionality for creating and deleting users, as well as initiating and deleting chats.
3. Provide real-time messaging and management features for both users and messages.
 
## Features
 
1. **User Management:**
   - Admins can create, delete, and manage users within the system.
   - Simple user registration and authentication via the application interface.
 
2. **Chat Functionality:**
   - Users can initiate chats with one or more participants.
   - The system supports one-on-one and group chats.
 
3. **Message Management:**
   - Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
   - Users have the ability to delete messages, allowing them to manage their chat history.
 
4. **Simple User Interface:**
   - The user interface was built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), providing a clean, easy-to-use platform for communication.
   - The application ensures an intuitive experience for both end-users and administrators.
 
## Technology Stack
 
- **Frontend:** WPF for the user interface, providing a modern desktop application experience.
- **Backend:** ASP.NET and C# for building the chat application's server-side logic and user management system.
- **Database:** MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of user data, chat history, and messages.
 
## Git Repository
