**Project Overview:**
Gipfelportal is a comprehensive and user-friendly scheduling application designed specifically for lift companies. This web and mobile platform aims to streamline workforce management by automating the processes of shift planning, vacation requests, and sick leave tracking. The goal is to replace the current paper-based system with a digital solution, offering real-time updates and centralized access for employees, administrators, and main administrators.
 
## Objectives
 
1. Develop a responsive and intuitive application that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
2. Automate the management of work schedules, vacation requests, sick leave, and task assignments.
3. Create distinct roles for users (employees, administrators, main administrator) with varying access levels and capabilities.
4. Replace the existing Excel-based scheduling system with an efficient, error-free, and real-time digital platform.
 
## Features
 
1. **User Roles & Authentication:**
   - Employees, administrators, and the main administrator will each have tailored access to the application based on their role.
   - Secure login and authentication processes ensure that sensitive data is protected.
 
2. **Work Schedule Management:**
   - Administrators can create, edit, and manage the service schedule for employees.
   - Employees can view their working hours in both weekly and monthly formats.
   - Changes to the schedule can be made in real time, and the system automatically saves the schedule at the end of each month.
 
3. **Vacation & Sick Leave Tracking:**
   - Administrators can easily manage and track vacation and sick leave requests.
   - Employees can submit vacation or sick leave requests through the app, and administrators can approve or deny them with a few clicks.
 
4. **To-Do Lists & Task Assignments:**
   - Administrators can assign tasks and set up to-do lists for employees, ensuring that everyone stays on track with their responsibilities.
 
5. **Real-Time Alerts & Notifications:**
   - Administrators can send notifications and reminders to employees about upcoming events, shift changes, or tasks that need to be completed.
 
6. **Main Administrator Features:**
   - Main administrators have full control over locations, administrators, and user accounts, including the ability to add, edit, and delete accounts as needed.
 
## Technology Stack
 
- **Frontend:** Angular, Bootstrap, and VSCode for building a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend:** C# and ASP.NET for the server-side logic and API integration.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, schedules, and task information.
- **Authentication:** Secure login using OAuth or other secure methods to protect sensitive user data.
 
## Git Repository
 
The project's code and development progress can be found on GitHub: [Diplomarbeit Repo](https://github.com/DaAlfi/Diplomarbeit)
 
## Outcome
 
Gipfelportal will revolutionize the scheduling and management process for lift companies, moving away from time-consuming, manual Excel sheets to an efficient, automated platform. By offering real-time updates, centralized information, and user-friendly interfaces, the application significantly reduces administrative workload and improves communication between employees and administrators.
 
**Note:** This case study is part of a larger project created as part of my diploma thesis and the school project at HTL St.Johann. The project aims to modernize and digitalize the workforce management system for lift companies.
